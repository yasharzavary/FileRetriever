Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This mechanism involves chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of oxygen and glucose. Scientists continue to explore ways to enhance photosynthesis efficiency for agricultural benefits.
